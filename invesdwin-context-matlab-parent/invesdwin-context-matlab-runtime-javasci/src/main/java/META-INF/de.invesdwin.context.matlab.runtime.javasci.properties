# might require LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/scilab/lib/scilab/;/opt/scilab/lib/thirdparty/;/opt/scilab/lib/thirdparty/redist/"
# specify where the libjavasci2.so and libscilab.so resides on your computer (which you might normally add to java.library.path manually, though comma separated here)
# on Windows one needs to only set PATH=C:\tools\scilab-2024.0.0\bin\ for this to work
# sadly on linux this currently does not work due to:
#     Scilab startup function detected that the function proposed to the engine is the wrong one. Usually, it comes from a linker problem in your distribution/OS.
#     Here, Scilab should have 'libscijvm-disable' defined but gets 'libscijvm' instead.
#     If you do not know what it means, please report a bug on https://gitlab.com/scilab/scilab/-/issues. If you do, you probably know that you should change the link order in SCI/modules/Makefile.am
